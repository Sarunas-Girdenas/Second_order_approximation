Second_order_approximation
==========================

Python version of Schmit-Grohe & Uribe (2004) matlab code for second-order approximation of DSGE models.
This code is written by Sarunas Girdenas and Hyun Chang Yi. For contacts please use sg325@exeter.ac.uk
Please feel free to this code in any way. 

This code could be used to solve DSGE models up to the second order
approximation and replicates the results from Schmit-Grohe and Uribe (2004). We also have used some
codes from Chris Sims (in particular qzdiv and qzswitch).

Obviously this code could be improved in many ways, but we leave it for further research.
